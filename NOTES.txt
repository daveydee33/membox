# Install project dependencies.  'save' will save them to the package.json (i think...)
# --save-dev will save them to devDependencies in the pacakge.json.
# many changes require restart node webserver.  the nodemon will monitor for file changes and auto restart.
  npm install --save express
  npm install --save mongodb
  npm install --save-dev react react-dom
  npm install --save-dev webpack
  npm install --save-dev babel-cli babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-2 babel-preset-react
  npm install --save-dev nodemon

  npm install -g bower



Note to starting a project.
- git init
- npm init
  - creates package.json with some default info about the project (description, author, version, license, etc.)
- npm install (--save express)
  - adds 'express' dependencies to package.json and downloads them to 'node_modules' dir.
- add a script line to package.json for nodemon.
  - this is so that i can use "npm start" and it know what file to start the application AND uses nodemon that watches for file updates and automatically restarts the node server so I don't have to keep doing it manually.
  - "start": "nodemon app.js"
- create: .gitignore
  - this file excludes stuff from uploading to git.
  - add this line to the file: node_modules
- create: .bowerrc
  - add this line.  this installs all the bower stuff (bootstrap, css, jss) to a 'lib' directory so it doesn't get mixed up with rest of our own js and css files
  {
    "directory": "public/lib"
  }

- create the directory structures...
- public to hold static HTML/CSS ?
- start testing the app.js with express?

- bower init
  - bower is like the front end package manager.
  - works a lot like npm.
- bower install --save bootstrap
  - will save bootstrap and jquery to public/lib... because we defined in .bowerrc
- bower install font-awesome --save


Downloaded JSHint and JSCS config files and copied to my project.

.jscsrc
.jshintrc

node install -g jshint
node install -g jscs


# installed Gulp (globally)
npm install -g gulp 

# but then we also have to install it locall to the project
npm install --save-dev gulp
